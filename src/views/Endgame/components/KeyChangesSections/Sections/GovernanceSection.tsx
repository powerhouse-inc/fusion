      Due to voter apathy within MakerDAO governance and DAOs more broadly, the DAO will transition from a model of
      recognized delegates to two groups consisting of aligned voter committees, and aligned delegates. MKR holders who
      are interested in Maker governance can now participate in voter committees of their liking to discuss policy with
      the relevant delegates.

      Before Endgame, Maker Improvement Proposals allowed any change to Maker Governance without much restriction or
      direction. The Endgame plan introduces the Maker Atlas which defines much better what the core business of the
      Maker Protocol is all about. It also introduces five Scope Artifacts which defines how Maker should operate within
      different operational areas.
